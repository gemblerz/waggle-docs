# Updating Docs

1. click "edit this page" at the bottom of the document of interest.
2. change the markdown.
3. commit the file using either "Commit directly to the main branch" or "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

> _Note_: if review is needed, use a pull request (PR).  Github will automatically run a test build against PRs, but will not deploy the document until it merged.

4. If committing directly to main, ensure the update was deployed:

> _Note_: it may take a few seconds/minutes for the deploy to be propagated to github's servers and show up at https://docs.sagecontinuum.org.
